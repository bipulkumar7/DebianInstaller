 <title>Shutting down the system</title>

<para>

To shut down a running &debian-gnu; system, you must not reboot with the
reset switch on the front or back of your computer, or just turn off
the computer.  &debian-gnu; should be shut down in a controlled manner,
otherwise files might get lost and/or disk damage might occur. If you run a
desktop environment, there is usually an option to <quote>log out</quote>
available from the application menu that allows you to shutdown (or reboot)
the system.

Alternatively you can press the key combination <keycombo>
<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> <keycap>Alt</keycap> <keycap>Del</keycap> </keycombo>
<phrase arch="powerpc"> or <keycombo> <keycap>Control</keycap>
<keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>Power</keycap> </keycombo> on Macintosh
systems</phrase>.
If the key combinations do not work, a last option is to log in as root
and type the necessary commands.
Use <command>reboot</command> to reboot the system.
Use <command>halt</command> to halt the system without powering it off
<footnote>

 <para>
  Under the SysV init system <command>halt</command> had the same
  effect as <command>poweroff</command>, but with systemd as init
  system (the default in jessie) their effects are different.
 </para>

</footnote>.
To power off the machine, use <command>poweroff</command>
or <command>shutdown -h now</command>.
The systemd init system provides additional commands that perform
the same functions; for example <command>systemctl reboot</command>
or <command>systemctl poweroff</command>.
