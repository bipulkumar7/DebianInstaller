<para>

The <application>Disk Utility</application> application can be found under the
<filename>Utilities</filename> menu in Mac OS X Installer. It will not adjust 
existing partitions; it is limited to partitioning the entire disk at once.

Remember to create a placeholder partition for GNU/Linux, preferably
positioned first in the disk layout. it doesn't matter what type it
is, it will be deleted and replaced later inside the &debian-gnu; installer.

&debian; installer partition table editing tools are compatible with OS X, 
but not with MacOS 9. If you are planning to use both MacOS 9 and OS X, it 
is best to install OS X and &debian; on one hard drive, and put MacOS 9 
on a separate hard drive.  Separate options for OS 9 and OS X will appear when 
holding the <keycap>option</keycap> key at boot time, and separate
options can be installed in the <application>yaboot</application> boot menu as 
well.

GNU/Linux is unable to access information on UFS partitions, but can access 
HFS+ (aka MacOS Extended) partitions. OS X requires one of these
two types for its boot partition. MacOS 9 can be installed on either HFS
(aka MacOS Standard) or HFS+. To share information between the Mac OS X and
GNU/Linux systems, an exchange partition is handy. HFS, HFS+ and MS-DOS FAT
file systems are supported by MacOS 9, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.
