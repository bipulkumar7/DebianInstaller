Complete information concerning supported peripherals can be found at

<para>

Nearly all x86-based (IA-32) processors still in use in personal
computers are supported.  This also includes 32-bit AMD and VIA
(former Cyrix) processors, and processors like the Athlon XP and Intel
P4 Xeon.

However, &debian; GNU/Linux &releasename; will

<note><para>

If your system has a 64-bit processor from the AMD64 or Intel 64 families,
you will probably want to use the installer for the amd64 architecture instead
of the installer for the (32-bit) i386 architecture.

   <sect3 id="bus"><title>I/O Bus</title>
<para>

The system bus is the part of the motherboard which allows the CPU to
communicate with peripherals such as storage devices.  Your computer
must use the PCI, PCIe, or PCI-X bus.  Essentially all personal computers
sold in recent years use one of these.
