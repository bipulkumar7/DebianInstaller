If your computer will boot from USB, this will probably be the easiest
route for installation. Assuming you have prepared everything from
<xref linkend="boot-dev-select"/> and <xref
linkend="boot-usb-files"/>, just plug your USB stick into some free
USB connector and reboot the computer.  The system should boot up, and
unless you have used the flexible way to build the stick and not
enabled it, you should be presented with a graphical boot menu (on
hardware that supports it). Here you can select various installer
options, or just hit &enterkey;.
