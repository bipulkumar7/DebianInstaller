"accepted by default on most UEFI systems with secure boot is a key from "
"Microsoft used for signing the Windows bootloader. As the boot code used by "
"&d-i; is not signed by Microsoft, booting the installer requires prior "
"deactivation of secure boot in case it is enabled. Secure boot is often "
"enabled by default on systems that come preinstalled with a 64-bit version "
"of Windows 8 and there is unfortunately no standard way to disable it in the "
"UEFI setup. On some systems, the option to disable secure boot is only made "
"visible when a BIOS password has been set by the user, so if you have a "
"system with secure boot enabled, but cannot find an option to disable it, "
"try setting a BIOS password, powercycle the machine and look again for an "
"appropriate option."

"Windows 8 offers a feature called <quote>fast boot</quote> to cut down "
"system startup time. Technically, when this feature is enabled, Windows 8 "
"does not do a real shutdown and a real cold boot afterwards when ordered to "
"shut down, but instead does something resembling a partial suspend to disk "
"to reduce the <quote>boot</quote> time. As long as Windows 8 is the only "
"operating system on the machine, this is unproblematic, but it can result in "
"problems and data loss when you have a dual boot setup in which another "
"operating system accesses the same filesystems as Windows 8 does. In that "
"case the real state of the filesystem can be different from what Windows 8 "
"believes it to be after the <quote>boot</quote> and this could cause "
"filesystem corruption upon further write accesses to the filesystem. "
"Therefore in a dual boot setup, to avoid filesystem corruption the "
"<quote>fast boot</quote> feature has to be disabled within Windows."

"It may also be necessary to disable <quote>fast boot</quote> to even allow "

"some UEFI systems, the firmware will reduce <quote>boot</quote> time by not "
"initialising the keyboard controller or USB hardware; in these cases, it is "
"necessary to boot into Windows and disable this feature to allow for a "
"change of boot order."
