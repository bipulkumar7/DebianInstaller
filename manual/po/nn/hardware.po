"Even if there is a vendor-provided closed-source driver for such hardware "

"not uncommon that a short time after a consumer device has ceased "
"production, no driver updates get made available any more by the "
"manufacturer. If the old closed-source driver does not work anymore after a "
"system update, an otherwise perfectly working device becomes unusable due to "
"lacking driver support and there is nothing that can be done in this case. "
"You should therefore avoid buying closed hardware in the first place, "
